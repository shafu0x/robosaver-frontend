# balancer-core-v2

Prototypes for the v2 architecture

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) ^12
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en)

## Installation

Run `yarn` to download all dependencies.

## Usage

All common tasks are implemented as scripts in the `package.json`, and can be run by passing them as arguments to `yarn`.

`yarn compile` and `yarn test` are the two main Solidity workflow tasks, and both have watch modes variants (`yarn test:watch`). Note that `yarn test` does not compile files: if running tests and changing Solidity source code at the same time, it is recommended to run both commands in watch mode in two separate terminals (tests will run automatically on recompilation).

Gas measurements of common tasks can be obtained by running `yarn benchmark`.

## Directories

- `contracts`: source code for all smart contracts in the system.
  - `vault` stores the code for the `Vault` contract, which is split across a number of files to ease development.
  - `pools` keeps the code for the different Pool types and related contracts, such as factories.
  - `test` holds contracts that are only used for testing purposes, often with lax access control patterns and other 'unsafe' properties.
- `test`: unit tests for each smart contract, using [ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) and [waffle chai matchers](https://ethereum-waffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matchers.html). The `helpers` subdirectory holds utilities used to simplify writing assertions, deploying test contracts, etc., with the overall goal of making tests more ergonomic and less verbose.
- `scripts`: these execute tasks unrelated to testing, such as gas benchmarking, deployment, etc. The `helpers` subdirectory contains specialized utilities for our project to e.g. make deployment easier - some of these are also used in the tests.
