A single instance of it exists for the entire network, and it is the\n * entity used to interact with Pools by joining, exiting, or swapping with them.\n *\n * The `Vault`'s source code is split among a number of sub-contracts, with the goal of improving readability and making\n * understanding the system easier. All sub-contracts have been marked as `abstract` to explicitly indicate that only\n * the full `Vault` is meant to be deployed.\n *\n * Roughly speaking, these are the contents of each sub-contract:\n *\n *  - `UserBalance`: manage user balances (Internal Balance operations and external balance transfers)\n *  - `Fees`: set and compute protocol fees.\n *  - `FlashLoanProvider`: flash loans.\n *  - `PoolRegistry`: Pool registration, joining, exiting, and Asset Manager interactions.\n *  - `Swaps`: Pool swaps.\n *\n * Additionally, the different Pool specializations are handled by the `GeneralPoolsBalance`,\n * `MinimalSwapInfoPoolsBalance` and `TwoTokenPoolsBalance` sub-contracts, which in turn make use of the\n * `BalanceAllocation` library.\n *\n * The most important goal of the `Vault` is to make token swaps use as little gas as possible. This is reflected in a\n * multitude of design decisions, from minor things like the format used to store Pool IDs, to major features such as\n * the different Pool specialization settings.\n *\n * Finally, the large number of tasks carried out by the Vault means its bytecode is very large, which exceeds\n * the contract size limit imposed by EIP 170 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170). Manual tuning of the source code\n * was required to improve code generation and bring the bytecode size below this limit. This includes extensive\n * utilization of `internal` functions (particularly inside modifiers), usage of named return arguments, and dedicated\n * storage access methods, to name a few.\n */\ncontract Vault is VaultAuthorization, FlashLoanProvider, Swaps {\n    constructor(\n        IAuthorizer authorizer,\n        IWETH weth,\n        uint256 emergencyPeriod,\n        uint256 emergencyPeriodCheckExtension\n    )\n        VaultAuthorization(authorizer)\n        AssetHelpers(weth)\n        EmergencyPeriod(emergencyPeriod, emergencyPeriodCheckExtension)\n    {\n        // solhint-disable-previous-line no-empty-blocks\n    }\n\n    function setEmergencyPeriod(bool active) external override nonReentrant authenticate {\n        _setEmergencyPeriod(active);\n    }\n\n    // solhint-disable-next-line func-name-mixedcase\n    function WETH() external view override returns (IWETH) {\n        return _WETH();\n    }\n}\n"

'cash' is how many\n// tokens the Pool has sitting inside of the Vault. 'managed' is how many tokens were withdrawn from the Vault by the\n// Pool's Asset Manager. 'total' is the sum of these two, and represents the Pool's total token balance, including\n// tokens that are *not* inside of the Vault.\n//\n// 'cash' is updated whenever tokens enter and exit the Vault, while 'managed' is only updated if the reason tokens are\n// moving is due to an Asset Manager action. This is reflected in the different methods available: 'increaseCash'\n// and 'decreaseCash' for swaps and add/remove liquidity events, and 'cashToManaged' and 'managedToCash' for\n// events transferring funds to and from the asset manager.\n//\n// The Vault disallows the Pool's 'cash' ever becoming negative, in other words, it can never use any tokens that\n// are not inside of the Vault.\n//\n// One of the goals of this library is to store the entire token balance in a single storage slot, which is why we use\n// 112 bit unsigned integers for 'cash' and 'managed'. Since 'total' is also a 112 bit unsigned value, any combination\n// of 'cash' and 'managed' that yields a 'total' that doesn't fit in that range is disallowed.\n//\n// The remaining 32 bits of each storage slot are used to store the most recent block number when a balance was\n// updated. This can be used to implement price oracles that are resilient to 'sandwich' attacks.\n//\n// We could use a Solidity struct to pack these two values together in a single storage slot, but unfortunately Solidity\n// only allows for structs to live in either storage, calldata or memory. Because a memory struct still takes up a\n// slot in the stack (to store its memory location), and because the entire balance fits in a single stack slot (two\n// 112 bit values), using memory is strictly less gas performant.
